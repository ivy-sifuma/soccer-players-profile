Guidelines for Staying Organized
Write down the decisions you make about your project. This will not only help you think more clearly, it will also help you communicate your project to instructors when asking for help. In addition to writing everything down, we also recommend the following to help stay organized and on track:
Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).
Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need
Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.
Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.
Continue building features one by one.
Check in with your instructors to make sure your scope and timeline are manageable.

Project Pitches
Before you start working on your project, you'll pitch your project idea to your instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:

The basic story of your application
The core features of your MVP
The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
Challenges you expect to face
How you are meeting the requirements of the project
Feel free to send this pitch to your instructor via slack asynchronously.
